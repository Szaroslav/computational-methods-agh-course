hachiko was born on november 10, 1923, at a farm near the city of odate, akita
prefecture. in 1924, hidesaburo ueno, a professor at the tokyo imperial university,
brought him to live in shibuya, tokyo, as his pet. hachiko would meet ueno
atshibuya station every day after his commute home. this continued until may 21,
1925, when ueno died of a cerebral hemorrhage while at work. from then until his
death on march 8, 1935, hachiko would return to shibuya station every day to
await ueno's return.

during his lifetime, the dog was held up in japanese culture as an example of
loalty and fidelity. since his death, he continues to be remembered worldwide in
popular culture with statues, movies and books. hachiko is known in japanese as
chuken hachiko (faithful dog hachiko), hachi meaning eight and the suffix -ko
originating as one once used for ancient chinese dukes; thus, hachiko could be
roughly translated as either mr. eight or sir eight.
